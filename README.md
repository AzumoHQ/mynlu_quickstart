`node`
`npm`
`git`

### Required Tools Links

## Get the myNLU Rasa quickstart and configure it

From the command line clone the repository into a mynlu-qs directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AzumoHQ/mynlu_quickstart.git mynlu-qs`
```

Go into that directory:
```sh
cd mynlu-qs
```


Install node dependencies:
```sh
npm install

Setup the application with the name `mynlu-qs-test` (you WILL need to choose another name):
```sh
npm run setup -- mynlu-qs-test

`mynlu-rasa` access. 

Youâ€™re good to go!
