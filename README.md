# myNLU Rasa in 3 minutes
You will need to have installed command line versions of:
`heroku`
`node`
`npm`
`git`

## Get the myNLU Rasa quickstart and configure it

From the command line clone the repository into a mynlu-qs directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AzumoHQ/mynlu_quickstart.git mynlu-qs`
```

Go into that directory:
```sh
cd mynlu-qs
```


Install node dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

Setup the application with the name `mynlu-qs-test` (you WILL need to choose another name):
```sh
npm run setup -- mynlu-qs-test
```


This final step will check that you have heroku, npm, node, git installed, create a Heroku app with the name 
`mynlu-qs-test`, provision the mynlu-rasa add-on, and create a local `.env` file with the settings for your 
`mynlu-rasa` access. TL;DR: youâ€™re good to go!

## Starting your app locally
From the command line run:
```sh
npm run start
```

Now point your browser to: `http://localhost:3000`
